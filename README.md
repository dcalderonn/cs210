Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.</br></br>
This program, created by Derbi Calderon, is designed to analyze text records generated throughout the day for a store named Corner Grocer. It provides a menu with options to search for item frequencies, print item frequencies, print a histogram, or exit the program.</br></br>
What did you do particularly well?</br></br>
What was done particularly well in this project was the implementation of the different functionalities like searching for item frequencies, printing item frequencies, and generating a histogram. The code is structured using classes and functions, which helps with code organization and readability.</br></br>
Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?</br></br>
One area where the code could be enhanced is by implementing input validation. Currently, if the user enters invalid input, such as non-numeric characters for a numeric input, the program encounters an error. Implementing input validation would make the code more robust and user-friendly.</br></br>
Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?</br></br>
Writing the code for printing the histogram might have been challenging since it involves formatting the output and using colors. The use of the escape sequences for colors, as well as iterating through the itemFreq map, can be a bit tricky. To overcome this challenge, the code correctly uses a color array and a color index variable to rotate through the available colors.</br></br>
What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?</br></br>
Skills gained from this project that are transferable to other projects include file handling, working with maps to store data, creating menus and user interfaces, and implementing basic input validation. These skills can be applied in various programming projects and coursework that involve data analysis, user interaction, and file manipulation.</br></br>
How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?</br></br>
To make the program maintainable, readable, and adaptable, the code uses meaningful variable names, follows a consistent indentation style, and includes comments to explain the purpose of each function and major code sections. The use of classes and functions helps modularize the code, making it easier to modify or extend in the future.</br></br>
